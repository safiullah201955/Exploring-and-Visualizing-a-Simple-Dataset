# Task Objective

The objective of this task is to explore the Iris dataset using EDA techniques. It includes:
Loading and understanding the dataset structure
Visualizing feature distributions and relationships between variables
Extracting key insights to support future AI/ML model development

## Dataset Used

The project uses the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in statistics and machine learning.
| Feature        | Description                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `sepal_length` | Sepal length in cm                           |
| `sepal_width`  | Sepal width in cm                            |
| `petal_length` | Petal length in cm                           |
| `petal_width`  | Petal width in cm                            |
| `species`      | Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) |
Total Samples: 150
Classes: 3 species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
Source: Seabornâ€™s built-in dataset

## Key Results and Findings

Petal features (length & width) show clear separation between species.
Sepal features overlap slightly, especially between Versicolor and Virginica.
Petal dimensions are likely to be highly predictive for classification tasks in future modeling stages.
